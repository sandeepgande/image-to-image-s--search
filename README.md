# IMAGE-IMAGE(S)-SEARCH

This is a project to provide similar image search results based on an image input.

### Important steps :

This project involves two major steps

1) Recognizing the content of the input image using a pre-trained ML model.

2) Fetching the images with similar content using an API.

### Machine learning model :
I have used inception net v3 (Pre-trained model) for the image recognition process.

### API Reference:

I have used Google Custom Search API to fetch image results. Click on the following link for more information related to the API.

Note: Add your respective Developer key and CX before testing the code in your local environment.

### UI and Deployment Process

I have used streamlit web frame work for designing the webpage and Streamlit cloud for deployment.
You can refer to the following link for more info.
